# aradwann.github.io


This is my blog, powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site engine and a *modified [DeepThought](https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/DeepThought) theme.

*modified: I modified the theme to my needs, 
 - dropping many dependencies
 - replaced jQuery lines with vanilla ES6,
 - added gallery shortcode, removed some and edited some.
 - edited some scss, spacing, font, ..etc
